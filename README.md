# ProjectManagementSystem

This project was made as a submission for COL106 course assignment.

This is a project management system made using self implemented Red-Black Trees, Tries and Priority Queue using MaxHeap.
This required us to implement a system to handle various jobs and users within each project along with their budget and priorities.

More information about implementation is given in the src folder.
